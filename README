Pimad: Pimad Is Modeling Adaptive Dynamics
=====

Pimad is a modeling tool for studying adaptive evolution of grouping by adhesion.

## Quick start:

Here is an example to compute a PIP (pairwise invasibility plot) using the toy model.

```python
# Compute a pip
from pimad.models.toycontinuous import ToyContinuous
from pimad.pip import mp_pip
from pimad.draw import pip as pip_draw 

param = ToyContinuous.EXAMPLE_PARAMETERS
param["pip_step"] = .01 # The trait step 
param["lk_R"] = 1000 # Nuber of trajectories for the MLE of the invasion fitness
param["invfitness_g"] = 10 # Length of trajectories for the MLE of the invasion fitness
param["replica"] = 25 # Average on this number of replications.
param["ip"] = 0.01 # Initial proportion of mutants.

p = mp_pip(ToyContinuous,param)
pip_d(p[0])
plt.show()
```

Note that if you want to implement a new model, you just have to write
a class inheriting from another model (or the most general `Model`
class) and overwrite the relevant methods (e.g `dispersion`,
`aggregation`, `payoff` or `demographics`).

## Folder organization

- The `pimad/` folder contains the library files (the simulation
  engine but also some predefined models in `pimad/models/`)

- The `bin/` folder contains the script used to produce the published results,
  it is best executed using `make` and the `Makefile` provided. Be
  careful some of them are very long to compute. The script produce
  some pickled files containing data and parameters.

- Finally the `notebook/` folder contains small boilerplate code to
  produce visual representation of those results, i.e. the figures of the publication.
