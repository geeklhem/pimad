 PIMAD : Pimad is modeling adaptive dynamics 

Pimad is a modeling tool for studying adaptive evolution of grouping by adhesion.

Example:

```python
# Compute a pip
from pimad.models.toycontinuous import ToyContinuous
from pimad.pip import mp_pip
from pimad.export.draw import pip as pip_draw

param = ToyContinuous.EXAMPLE_PARAMETERS
param["pip_step"] = .01
param["lk_R"] = 1000
param["invfitness_g"] = 10
param["replica"] = 25
param["ip"] = 0.01

p = mp_pip(ToyContinuous,param)
pip_d(p[0])
plt.show()
```


You can compute the figures from the article by using the Makefile in the `/bin` folder.
The generated figures and data are in the '/notebook' folder.
